If not defined (line commented): ESP tries to connect to WiFi using SSID and password provided above. These are included in the firmware and cannot be changed later on unless flashing with a new firmware. 

If defined (line uncommented):
- WiFi SSID and password can be changed from the web interface in the 'System' tab (page at url /infos).
- In addition, the startup sequence is changed to allow access in case wrong WiFi credentials are provided:
	- At startup, ESP tries to connect to WiFi using SSID and password saved in EEPROM memory (persistent memory).
	- If it succeeds, espRFLinkMQTT finishes its startup.
	- If it fails to connect, after a period of time (WIFI_CONNECT_TIMEOUT, 60 seconds by default), it starts a WiFi Access Point.
	- The access point name is HOSTNAME defined above (espRFLinkMQTT by default).
	- By connecting to this access point, it is possible to change WiFi settings by pointing browser to url http://192.168.4.1/infos
	- Once wifi settings are applied, just reboot the ESP by clicking on "Reboot ESP".
	- The access point stays only available for a duration of WIFI_AP_TIMEOUT (5 minutes by default). After that time, ESP goes back to a normal connection mode and tries again to connect using WiFi credentials in memory. The goal is to allow ESP to connect in case it started before WiFi router and thus WiFi was not immediately available. Otherwise, ESP would stay blocked in access point mode.

// Note: ID filtering configuration is now saved in eeprom memory and can be changed online in the /configuration page.

/*
This is how CONFIG_VERSION works :
- At startup software reads config version in eeprom memory.
- If value is the same as above, it uses eeprom memory configuration.
- If it is different, it overwrites eeprom memory configuration with configuration contained in this file (config.h)
This applies to WiFi credentials, MQTT settings, ID filtering configuration.
It means that if changes were made online, it is safer to update configuration in this file not to lose them on next firmware update.
